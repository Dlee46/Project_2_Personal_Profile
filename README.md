# Project_2_Personal_Profile

## Summary
Project 2, Personal Profile, was created with the idea that it should be able to be used by anyone. It was not curtailed to any specific group for that reason keeping the design in general to be simple, clean, and minimalistic. The application is a full stack web site with 2 full CRUD's. It allows the user to create a userID that is unique and can basically create things that they want overall. It can be anything from a goal, wishlist, or even a planner. The color scheme behind this app was based off the idea and the weather during the time that this project was created.The follow libraries were used to create this project:

 - javaScript 
 - Node.js
 - hbs
 - express
 - materialize
 - google fonts
 - mongoose
 - mongodb
 - HTML5
 - CSS
 
 In the near future, I would like to add more design to this app along with more neat javascript functions like an authentication function for a password.
